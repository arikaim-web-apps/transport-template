            <li>
                processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.

            Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council,

            Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted

            We will share payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing
            your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.

        <p> 
            Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you,

            and handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including data collection and data processing. 
            The Payment Processors&#8217; use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which 
            may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy.

            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. 
            Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, 
            tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across 
            different websites over time. The Services do not track its visitors over time and across third-party websites. 
            However, some third-party websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, 
            which enables them to tailor what they present to you. For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices or to
